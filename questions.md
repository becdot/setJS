To Do

  - Computer highlights cards when it makes a move
  - Highlighting = highlighting?
  - Resize properly with window resizing
  - Buttons for opening screen -- easy, medium, and hard are different buttons (also prettier!)
  - Solo mode
  - Computer countdown (how much time before it makes a move)
  - Prettier score display -- graphs?
  - Striped cards have 50% intensity (instead of full intensity -- too much like solid cards)
  - Remove alerts -- too annoying
  - Have a list of sets along the edge of the screen, can see previous sets
  - Have cards be snazzy and slide off the screen (visualisations)
  - Better messaging to communicate when the computer has made a move
  - Button to add another three cards (have to check that no sets exist, otherwise player can cheat)
  - Alternatively, have a number that indicates the available sets on the board
