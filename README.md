###A pattern-matching game writen purely in JavaScript, based on the card game SET.

####A brief primer on SET:
- Each card has four attributes: number, colour, shading, and shape.  
- A set is formed by three cards where every attribute is either all the same, or all different.
    *  1 solid purple square, 2 solid green clovers, and 3 solid red circles ARE a set.
        +  All numbers are different
        +  All shadings are the same
        +  All colours are different
        +  All shapes are different
    * 1 solid purple square, 2 solid purple circles, and 3 solid purple squares are NOT a set
        + All numbers are different
        + All shadings are the same
        + All colours are the same
        + Two cards have diamonds and one has ovals
