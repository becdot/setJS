A pattern-matching game based on the card game SET, written purely in Javascript.

A brief primer on SET:
- Each card has four attributes: number, colour, shading, and shape.  
- A set is formed by three cards where every attribute is either all the same, or all different.
    *  1 solid purple diamond, 2 solid green squiggles, and 3 solid red ovals ARE a set.
        +  All numbers are different, all shadings are the same, all colours are different, and all shapes are different
    * 1 solid purple diamond, 2 solid purple ovals, and 3 solid purple diamonds are NOT a set
        + All numbers are different, all shadings are the same, all colours are the same, but two cards have diamonds and one has ovals
